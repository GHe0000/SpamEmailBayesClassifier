title signal processing approach to fast magnetic resonance imaging abstract magnetic resonance imaging mri has become an important imaging modality for clinical diagnosis and scientific research however mri is still relatively slow technique state of the art technology is capable of acquiring 3d images from static objects and 2d images from time varying objects it is desirable for number of applications to develop real time imaging capability in this presentation will discuss signal processing approach to fast imaging based on parallel data acquisition and generalized series reconstruction shall describe the associated data acquisition scheme and image reconstruction algorithm and show some examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the new approach in addition will give brief introduction to the graduate education at the electrical engineering department at texas amp university 研究 方向 兴趣 发邮件 jimji tamu edu 清华 出身 师兄
